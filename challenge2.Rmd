## Loading data
R comes with many cool datasets; lets use the `chickwts` dataset today. In these experiment chicks were randomly allocated into groups, and each group was given a different feed supplement.
```{r}
data("chickwts")
```

## Data checking
First lets look at what this dataset looks like:
```{r, echo = FALSE}
head(chickwts)
```

## Data exploration
```{r, echo = FALSE}
hist(chickwts$weight)
```

## Results
```{r, echo = FALSE}
boxplot(weight ~ feed, data = chickwts, col = "lightgray",
main = "chickwt data",
ylab = "Weight at six weeks (gm)")
```

## Complex Graphs
Just like working in an R plot window you can build up a graph a piece at a time.
```{r, echo=F}
hist(chickwts$weight)
abline(v=200, col="red", lwd=4)
text(200, 15, "Minimum size \n normal diet", pos=2)
```
