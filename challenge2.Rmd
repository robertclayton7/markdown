## Loading data

R comes with many cool datasets; lets use the `chickwts` dataset today.  In these experiment chicks were randomly allocated into groups, and each group was given a different feed supplement.

```{r}
data("chickwts")
```

## Data checking
First lets look at what this dataset looks like:
```{r, echo = FALSE}
head(chickwts)
```

## Data exploration
```{r, echo = FALSE}
hist(chickwts$weight)
```

## Results
```{r, echo = FALSE}
boxplot(weight ~ feed, data = chickwts, col = "lightgray",
    main = "chickwt data",
    ylab = "Weight at six weeks (gm)")
```
