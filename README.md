# Literate programming & R markdown

## Literate programming
Literate programming is an approach to writing code where we combine plain text and snippets of code.  This allows us to explain the logic and goals of our code as we develop it.  This makes it easier for our collaborators to understand our code, insures that we are using sound logic, and allows us to repeat analyses when data or assumptions change.  Literate programming is not dependent on any language and is an approach you can apply to whatever coding language you use.

## R markdown
Markdown is a language developed to allow users to write largely in plain text which can be converted to properly formatted html.  Many flavors of markdown have been developed each of which has its own nuances.  Because you are all using R already we will focus on using R markdown in Rstudio.

We will use the package knitr to facilitate processing of our markdown files:

```{r}
install.packages("knitr")
```
